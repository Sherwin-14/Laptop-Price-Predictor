# Laptop Price Predictor

## Problem Statement
A Laptop Price Predictor is needed to predict laptop prices with high accuracy.

In the dynamic market of laptops, predicting prices accurately is a challenging task. With a multitude of factors influencing laptop prices, from hardware specifications to brand value, there’s a need for a robust model that can predict laptop prices with high accuracy to aid both sellers and buyers.

## Our Solution
To address this, we developed a predictive model using the Scikit-learn library. Our model, trained on a comprehensive dataset of laptop prices and specifications, achieved an impressive accuracy of 89%. To make this model accessible and useful, we built a Flask backend that serves the model’s predictions. We chose MongoDB as our database to store and manage the data efficiently. The entire model was developed using Google Colab, a powerful cloud-based platform that supports collaborative development. Our solution not only predicts laptop prices but also provides insights into the factors influencing these prices, thereby serving as a valuable tool for both sellers and buyers in the laptop market.

## Future Outcomes
We aim to continuously improve the model's accuracy and expand its capabilities to predict prices for a wider range of laptops.
